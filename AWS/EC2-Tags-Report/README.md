To use, first edit the file by inserting your AWS config profile, then run script in your PowerShell terminal by copying and pasting the whole script.

This script will output a text file showing a list of your EC2 instances, their names (if available), and their tags, with proper separation between instances for easy readablility. 

The output file will also show the total number of instances and region at bottom of the file.

### Sample CSV Output
```csv
"AWS Profile","Region","Instance ID","Instance Name","State","Instance Type","Launch Time","Environment","Owner","Cost Center","Tag: Application"
"production","us-east-1","i-0123456789abcdef0","WebServer-Prod","running","t3.medium","2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z","Production","DevOps-Team","CC-12345","WebApp"
